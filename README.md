# 💊 AI-Driven Drug Discovery App

An intelligent web-based platform for accelerating drug discovery using artificial intelligence and machine learning. This system leverages molecular data, predictive modeling, and compound screening to suggest potential drug candidates effectively and efficiently.

## 🧬 Project Overview

This project aims to simplify the drug discovery pipeline using a combination of:
- Molecular descriptor generation
- Machine learning model training and prediction
- A clean frontend interface to upload and analyze compounds
- Visualization of compound properties and model performance

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js (Optional SPA interface)

**Backend:**
- Python (Flask / FastAPI)
- Pandas, NumPy, RDKit
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost / TensorFlow

**Database:**
- MongoDB

**Other Tools:**
- Docker (for containerization)
- Git/GitHub (for version control)

## 🚀 Features

- 🧪 Upload compound data (SMILES format or CSV)
- 🔍 Compute molecular descriptors using RDKit
- 🧠 Train ML models on labeled molecular datasets
- 📈 Predict biological activity or toxicity of new compounds
- 📊 Visualize compound structures and properties
- 🧰 REST API for model inference and data management
